I believe that this is the first step of solving the overall problem as I will require some of the assumptions such as the total capacity and travel limit to be initialized globally, and then certain more classes to be incorporated into the programming that I have done. Unfortunately, I could not fully test these two classes since I feel there are still missing pieces to implementation of M/D/1. Nevertheless, I think by commenting to describe what I have been doing, I have done a solid enough job on #codereadability as well, which will help me later on."
